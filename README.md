# Hiscore save/load

Save and load of the top 3 hiscores is supported on this core.

Warning: If any DIP settings are changed then your high score will reset.

To save your hiscores manually, press the 'Save Settings' option in the OSD.  Hiscores will be automatically loaded when the core is started.

To enable automatic saving of hiscores, turn on the 'Autosave Hiscores' option, press the 'Save Settings' option in the OSD, and reload the core.  Hiscores will then be automatically saved (if they have changed) any time the OSD is opened.

Hiscore data is stored in /media/fat/config/nvram/ as ```<mra filename>.nvm```
